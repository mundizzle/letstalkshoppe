Every major player in technology that isn’t Apple marches upon Sin City with the promise of the future in tow. This year, the future being touted is one that features televisions with 4K resolution and refrigerators that come with the latest version of Android. Not exactly 2001: A Space Odyssey.
                                                    CES wasn’t always like this. The mega technology conference used to be an introduction to the unknown and impossible. CES used to leave jaws on the floor and imaginations inspired by new possibilities. Then something funny happened. Technology captured enough of our attention to be worth…

                                                    may sound like a weird class for a 16-year-old to take or a high school to
                                                    offer, but in practice it was savvy: the school netted a built-in, small workforce
                                                    for IT support and repairs. Nothing like a little free
                                                    labor to make things go.
                                                    Going in, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d learn anything and when I finished I
                                                    felt the same way. After all, I&#39;d grown up around computers and was already the
                                                    de facto family IT person.
                                                    Over a decade later, working as a software engineer, I realized that
                                                    I&#39;d learned something very important.

He is the Don King to his chef-partner April Bloomfield’s vintage Mike Tyson. Lot’s of chefs and restaurateurs can get people to talk about their openings, but Ken has an uncanny ability to sustain the conversation. It’s relevant here, because his restaurants tend to be quite analog. The Pig, for example, doesn’t use OpenTable and doesn’t take reservations. The menu is divided into weird sections that don’t really make any sense.
                                                    Ken and I are working on a book project in fits and starts and it may never see the light of day.

                                                <p class="snippet">(Originally published November 2012.)
                                                    Some advice to companies interviewing at Y Combinator: stop focusing on hacks and just figure out your goddamn business.
                                                    Six months ago, some friends and I made a somewhat last-minute decision to apply to Y Combinator. Paul Graham told us our product was “too much of a ‘startup idea’ anyway”, and Sam Altman started our interview by telling us “this is the classic example of a bad startup idea”. As you may know, we got in, and are now working on TapIn.tv, the fastest way to share video.
                                                    So, what was our interview “hack”? We did everything we should have been doing all along.
                                                    Y Combinator holds its place as the most prestigious startup incubator for good reason - the partners are the smartest group of people you’re likely to meet. As you’d expect, it…

                                                    This season, however, is different.
                                                    The Kentucky Wildcats are a brand-new basketball team, literally. Not a single player on the roster started a single game last season. Even more amazing — only one player was part of the team’s ROTATION options (for non-sports fans, that means coming off the bench).
                                                    In a competitive college basketball world, the inexperience is tremendous. To go from a national championship squad to a team chuck-full of freshmen, some transfers and a rotation player — it’s a total shift in every sense of the word.
                                                    Prior to the start of the season, ESPN showed a bri…

                                                    unplugged each day. This time will then be divided into three categories:
                                                    input, output, or something physical. In the perfect world I would devote an
                                                    hour to each, but that sounds ridiculous at this point.
                                                    Also, I should point out that a lot of these goals aren’t
                                                    actually analog… they just aren’t aimless surfing, browsing, and clicking.
                                                    Input.
                                                    This is

                                                    in development, but what I’m really looking for is an escape from the endless
                                                    faucet of new.
                                                    I’ve found that my curiosity has dampened with Reddit.

I was consumed by the idea of TV because it I loved watching it but, more importantly, because I believed that television is America’s medium: More than any type of art or entertainment, what we watch represents where we are as a culture.
                                                    A few years later, the living room is now the tech industry’s newest battleground, and the future of how we consume content is at stake. Will we all be cutting the cord by 2015? Or start paying for channels á la carte? Nobody knows. For all the uncertainty, though, the fact remains: Television is what we watch and, regardless of how we get it, serialized programming will continue to play a huge role in how we digest the world around us.
                                                    And after all that, we’re just going to…

                                                    I read this post yesterday and then went out into the world to do some post-Christmas shopping for my Capricorn-birthday loved ones. This is always a sad time in big stores -- the spring merchandise isn&#39;t in yet and the marked-down holiday sparkly sweaters that seemed glamorous two weeks ago are revealed to be tacky now that they&#39;ve moved from the the front of the store to the back. I passed the textbook Barnes an…

I took out the pack of brand new tarot cards, also serving as part of a New Year’s Resolution to “Learn More Things”, that I had recently purchased on Amazon and idly flipped through them. A woman sitting across from me took note of my Weird Subway Behavior (yo, at least I wan’t cutting my fingernails), and asked if I was indeed handling a deck of Tarot cards. They’re slightly larger than normal playing cards, and mine have adorable stars on the back. I told her that they were, that I was just a beginner, and that I really didn&#39;t consider myself to have any mystical skills. She asked if I bel…</p>

Did you check in online?” She’s new, a receptionist or manager I haven&#39;t spotted in the four years I&#39;ve been coming here for my bimonthly six-dollar haircut.“Um … what?” I’m startled. This isn&#39;t the usual GreatClips interaction, in which I give them my phone number and they recite my usual: buzz the sides and back with a number-four clipper, thin it out on top, and try not to jab my poor busted cauliflower ears with the shears.“Online. Do you have a smartphone? You can check in online.”“Um.” It’s the weekend after New Years and I am fuzzy in several senses of the word. “I’ll check it out. Thanks.” Then we go through the familiar phone-number-and-usual-haircut dance, and she tells me it&#39;ll be fifteen minutes. Maybe. Assuming nobody who has checked in online shows up …</p>

                                                    Like the characters on Girls, I grew up with the assumption that I would attend college. It wasn’t until I was 22 that

                                                    It’s awards season.
                                                    Every couple of Sunday nights in January and February, various guilds and associations in Hollywood gather to bestow honors upon the finest works and performances of the previous year. Like clockwork, the season starts with the Golden Globes in mid-January, then the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards at the end of the month, the Grammys in early February, and the big kahuna, the Academy Awards, which caps it all off at month’s end. (The Emmys are awarded in September.)
                                                    But it’s not the awards shows themselves — self-congratulatory, often meaningless, and frequently too long by half — about which I care. It’s the pre-show, specifically E!’s two-hour “Live From T…

There is confetti and fireworks (literally and with a lucky smooch at midnight, maybe figuratively as well.) People are smiling, reveling, making merry, as if the New Year were a decorated military hero or American Idol winner returning to her hometown. Which is weird, right? I mean was the last year so terrible that its dying seconds warrant raucous celebration? What gives the New Year the right to waltz around as if it were the belle of the ball, well-liked but without anyone really knowing why, its supposed awesomesauce based on wispy rumors and dreamy notions? The Platonic Ideal of a Year, one thinks, this one will be it. Bah, I say. Double Bah with a dash of Humbug.

                                                    I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. … I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublim…

And while the signs of this care may shift depending on the reader’s tastes (I lean toward sentence-level experiments and uncanny twists in diction—pretty much anything Barry Hannah has put his name to), the broader, more platonic idea of care stays: a state of serious attention and thought. I want a writer I can trust.
                                                    Someone who takes the measure of both the message and the audience, who then relays said message with clear precision, is fantastic. But someone who pulls off a hat trick of substance, clarity, and style is an ingenious, glittering mutant.

His name is Bob, I call him pop-pop. After ten minutes together he&#39;ll usually begin telling his stories. They are good stories—mostly about athletic achievements, our family, and the war. There are only 4 or 5 of them and I know them by heart because I have been listening to them for the past 10 years. If I don&#39;t choose to be patient I find myself trying to finish them for him. The repetition is absolutely endearing.
                                                    When I saw him over Christmas he looked tired, and was a bit more hesitant to tell his stories around the table. I missed them. Like a kid wanting my dad to read me the same book over and over again each night, I wanted to hear to my pop-pop&#39;s stories. Not…

                                                    abstract: menus suck. we need less items, more pictures, and [just] a few recommendations. menus should be online, so they can integrate user data &amp; purchase history to customize selection, offer discounts, and to connect with friends for favorites and referrals / group offers. the market is huge, purchase behavior is frequent, industry incumbents are old, slow, and easily disrupted.everyone eats, everyone is online; what the hell we waiting for?
                                                    I don’t agree with Dave about menus. A menu is one of the most important expressions of a restaurant’s driving ethos and we are no where near hav…

I originally wrote these guidelines sometime in early 2010, when the Forrst community was just starting to become well-defined. My intention in doing so was to codify the types of behaviors I felt defined the &quot;right&quot; way to interact with the community: post only development- and design-related content, be a good citizen, be thoughtful, etc.
                                                    Overall, the guidelines were well-received. While there were always a small number of posts which broke one guideline or another, the majority of users adhered to — and in some cases even policed — the guidelines; they believed, as I believed, that they existed for the common good of the Forrst community.

                                                    I was in Cologne, Germany, and booze had never kept me in bed so late. I had made two attempts since 11 a.m. to lift my head from the pillow, neither of them successful. A throbbing headache was my primary reason for staying put, but my queasy stomach wasn’t turning down the quiet time, either. Eventually though, by mid-afternoon, my appetite got restless enough to coax my head out of bed. We can do this, it said.
                                                    I was staying at a youth hostel across the river from the old cathedral. My travelling mates were in another room, so the first thing I did after getting up was check on them. Wen…

                                                <h1>Overhauling the New Yankee Stadium</h1>
                                                <p class="snippet">In May, I posted “House of Steinbrenner,” the gist of which was that win or lose in 2012 (they lost), historically it’s been exponentially more fun being a Yankees fan than it is today. Mostly because the new Yankee Stadium, though state-of-the-art in many ways, isn’t a great place to watch a baseball game. Tickets are staggeringly expensive if you want to get close, one symptom of an overall disappointing value proposition. With the heart of the off-season upon us, I suggest 5 things the Yankees should do to fix the new Yankee Stadium in 2013 and beyond:
                                                    1. Other than via static posted advertisements, don’t monetize the in-game experience. Modell’s “Gotta Go to Mo’s” theme song plays when the Yankees steal a base. It shouldn’t. Fans will appreciate keeping the gameplay sacred.
